# Electrical-Circuits-Theory-Course-Material

I held the position of Head Teaching Assistant for the Electrical Circuit Theory course instructed by Dr. Bayat at Sharif University of Technology during the Fall of 2022. In this repository, I have compiled all the course materials related to this class.
- The materials for the theoretical assignments can be found in the "Theoretical Assignments" folder.
- The materials for the practical assignments can be found in the "Practical Assignments" folder.
- The materials for the final project can be found in the "Final Project" folder.

The objective of the practical assignments is to instruct students in the utilization of the PSpice software.
